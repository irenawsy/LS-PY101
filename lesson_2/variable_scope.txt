Q1. prints `5`. 
    `num` variable is first declared on line 1 with assigned value of `5`.
    `my_func()` is declared on lines 3-4.
    `my_func()` on line 6 executes `my_func()` defined on lines 3-4.
    `num` was NOT defined within the `my_func()` scope, so
    `print(num)` on line 4 accesses `num` outside the scope, 
    which has a value of `5`

Q2. prints `5`.
    `num` variable is first declared on line 1 with assigned value of `5`.
    `my_func()` is declared on lines 3-4.

    `num = 10` in line 4 creates `num` variable within the `my_func` scope,
    which is separate from the `num` variable declared outside the scope on line 1.
    Since `num = 10` is within the sub-function scope, 
    its value is not accessed outside the function scope.

    `my_func()` on line 6 calls on `my_func()` defined on lines 3-4.
    
    `print(num)` on line 7 accesses the `num` variable defined in the outer scope.

Q3. prints `10`
    `num` variable is first declared on line 1 with assigned value of `5`.
    `my_func()` is declared on lines 3-5.
    `global num` on line 4 within the `my_func()` declaration made the
    `num` variable global.
    `num` shall be assigned with a value of `10` on line 10.
   
    Calling on `my_func()` on line 7 executes the `my_func()`, 
    so line 10 was executed and `num` is re-assigned with value `10`
    
Q4. prints `Hello World`

Q5. Raises `NameError`

Q6. Prints 
    `Inner 1: 25`
    `Inner 2: 15`
